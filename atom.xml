    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Publishing with Google Drive as content sharing repository.</h2>

<p>We had situation where we can share the content before, like Drop Box, WebHard, iCloud.
So, why Google Drive is special?</p>

<pre><code>* It supports multi-platforms unlike iCloud, which is mostly geared for Apple centric workflow.

* It has the content editing capability unlike DropBox and several other services, which has mostly storage capabilities.

* It has API so that developers can use it with their programs. I can get information and edit the same data from the spreadsheet of customers using my program, if I know the user id and the password.
</code></pre>

<h2>This opens up a whole new way of publishing.</h2>

<p>I can imagine a publishing serve platform like the following.</p>
